# 2. Workflow for Coding Tasks
When I ask for a **feature implementation** or **refactoring**, follow this 3-step process:

## Step 1: Context Analysis
- Analyze relevant files and dependencies.
- Acknowledge the Docker environment (e.g., connection strings might differ).
- Check for existing MySQL models/schemas.

## Step 2: Implementation Plan
- Summarize the task and create a checklist.
- Consider MySQL specific behaviors (e.g., timestamp precision, charsets).

## Step 3: Coding
- Write production-ready code.
- Provide `docker-compose` command or SQL hints if schema changes are needed.
- Show code with context (don't just show the changed line).

# 3. Output Rules
- **Process:** Think in English (Logic/Reasoning), Output in Korean.
- **Tone:** Professional and Concise.
